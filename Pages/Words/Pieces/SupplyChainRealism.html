        Have you ever had a conversation about alternatives to capitalism? If so, you might have heard something similar to this retort: ‘Well what do you think makes all the stuff you need?’
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphs">
        In the West, when we look around, we see a great deal of objects, and we understand those objects as products of capitalism. 
        Some have been brought here from faraway shores, some are the crusty shelters that we’ve dug into the ground. 
        But in most all of them, we can intuit the series of processes that took to bring them together into a product, and we know that those processes and the associated relations were under capitalist terms. 
        Capitalism is encoded into our material landscape, and it is as hard to imagine extricating capitalism from our lives as it is to remove its influence from the objects we use and need.
