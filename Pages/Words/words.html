            Below is a list of different pieces of writing. 
            Some of them are quite short, because they are snippets of ideas or quick associations.
            With time, hopefully, some of them will grow, developing as the ideas they are trying to depict, refine, or experiment with become deeper, broader, and more layered.
            I list them here together as I hope that seeing them together will aid finding connections between them, rather than segmenting them as separate thoughts.
            They are listed in chronological order, most recently altered first.

            A bird from the sky right through the eye.
            <br>The bird had, for a brief moment, blocked the sun. In that instant, light flickered through as a splash, and coating and warming every feather on its body.
            <br>But its momentum carried it forward. Beak outstretched, it plummeted towards the heart of my pupil. 
            <br>I closed my lids before we made our deep embrace. Feathers warm from its flight. Sky grounded, air becomes full, sun meets the earth.

            Have you ever had a conversation about alternatives to capitalism? If so, you might have heard something similar to this retort: ‘Well what do you think makes all the stuff you need?’
<br>In the West, when we look around, we see a great deal of objects, and we understand those objects as products of capitalism. 
Some have been brought here from faraway shores, some are the crusty shelters that we’ve dug into the ground. 
But in most all of them, we can intuit the series of processes that took to bring them together into a product, and we know that those processes and the associated relations were under capitalist terms. 
Capitalism is encoded into our material landscape, and it is as hard to imagine extricating capitalism from our lives as it is to remove its influence from the objects we use and need.

            I want to train to be a carpenter, because I think the world is going to really change a lot in the coming years, but I think making things with wood will remain.
