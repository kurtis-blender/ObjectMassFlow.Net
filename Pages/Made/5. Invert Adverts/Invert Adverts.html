        <h1 class="title">BDS Invert Adverts</h1>
        <p class="description">I have been finding it difficult to remember the companies that make up the list of BDS targets. Consumer boycotts are a powerful and material form of grassroots political action taken against the Israeli genocide and occupation of Palestinians and Palestine, by targeting private companies that support and benefit from Israel's crimes against the Palestinian people.
            <br>It struck me that these companies spend millions of dollars every year producing media that has the sole purpose of making me remember them. So I have taken those advertisements and inverted them. Just as the timelines and colours have been inverted, so is their purpose. These are advertisements for boycotting these companies. Because they profit from apartheid and genocide.
            <br>More information can be found as the BDS campaign at www.bdsmovement.net</p>
